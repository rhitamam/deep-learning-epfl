# deep-learning-project-epfl

This repository is home to two deep learning mini-projects.

The objective of the first mini-project is to gain proficiency with the PyTorch library. It involves experimenting with various deep learning models to tackle a specified problem, followed by an analysis and comparison of the networks' abilities and performance in solving the problem at hand.

In the second mini-project, the goal is to delve deeper into the inner workings of PyTorch or similar deep learning libraries. This is achieved by developing a simplified "deep learning framework" from scratch, explicitly avoiding the use of PyTorch's autograd and neural-network modules.
